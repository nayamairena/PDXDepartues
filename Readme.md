The purpose of this program is to ease the task of collecting daily departure times for flights from PDX Airport. The data will be scraped from the FLYPDX departues website and written out to a document to be able to print for daily use at my job. We are required daily to manually copy and paste these times into a document and print them out. Arrival times are not important because they usually leave the airport as soon as they arrive. Departues are highlighted because those passengers will be more likely to eat at my job and it a good indication of how busy our day will be.
More functionality such as allowing the choice of gates will be added on later. Right now the focus is to pull departure times for flights in concourse D. I will also eventually add functionality of looking at arrival flights if necessary.
